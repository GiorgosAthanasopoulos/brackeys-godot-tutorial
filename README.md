# brackeys-godot-tutorial
Simple platformer game made in godot by following brackey's brand new godot tutorial.

## Extra stuff I have added
- Jump sound effect (audiostreamplayer node in player scene, call .play in _process of player script when jumping),
- Death sound effect (audiostreamplayer node in killzone scene, call .play in _on_body_entered of killzone script before starting timer).
